The Vector class is similar to a traditional Java array, 
except that it can grow as necessary to accommodate new elements.
Like an array, elements of a Vector object can be accessed via an index into the vector.
you don't have to worry about setting it to a specific size upon creation,
it shrinks and grows automatically when necessary.
Vector proves to be very useful if you don't know the size of the array in advance or 
you just need one that can change sizes over the lifetime of a program.
